# Visualizing correlations

[This](https://rpsychologist.com/correlation/) interactive visualization shows correlation for a set of points, but makes it interactive so you can see how changing the position of the points makes it more or less corralated. To interact, you can either drag the bar on the top to change the desired correlation, or you can drag individual points. 

I like this vis because it give a ton of inspiration for how to visualize correlation and how might people interact with it. I don't think it is effective in identifying correlation and only serves as a neat trick in my opinion. Its hard to learn with that level of interactivity (dragging the points) because it requires too much effort to significantly change the points. Also, theres no clear way as to how the line is changing each time. Some indication of way changing a particular point changes the line in that way might be useful.

One thing I did like was how it transformed the data when you use the slider above. This is a great idea for how to show differences in correlation.
